The University of Bonn, founded almost 200 years ago, is considered to be one of Germany's and indeed Europe's most important institutes of higher education. As home of learning to over 31,000 students, Bonn enjoys an outstanding reputation for research and teaching both at home and abroad. The University of Bonn is one of the world's leading research Universities.

The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Bonn comprises 8 sections and 29 institutes. The outstanding research performance of the faculty has been recognized by the Excellence Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation with the establishment of the excellence cluster “Hausdorff Center for Mathematics”. In addition a large number of graduate colleges, DFG (German Research Council) and BMBF (German Ministry of Education and Research) Research Priority Programs are performed at the faculty. 

The **Institute for Computer Science** at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was founded in 1975 as one of the first of its kind in Germany. More than 20 professors teach and conduct research at the institute. About 100 scientists and faculty support 1,900 students. With the Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology (B-IT),founded in 2002, a joint initiative of the University of Bonn, RWTH Aachen and the Fraunhofer Institutes in Sankt Augustin-Birlinghoven the computer science in Bonn hasbeen expanded and strengthened. Companies and organizations in the region support the institute through the Bonn Informatik Gesellschaft (BIG). The Institute offers a Bachelor ofcomputer science as well as an English-language Computer Science master's programand is a major participant in the study programs Life Science Informatics and Media at theB-IT. 

The Enterprise information systems and Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning groups are involved in OpenBudgets.eu. The latter group is part of the Chair of Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (led by Prof. Dr. Stefan Wrobel). The group focuses onthe neighboring subfields of computer science known as knowledge discovery indatabases (KDD, sometimes referred to simply as data mining) and machine learning (ML). These fields include on the one hand the automated analysis of large data sets using intelligent algorithms that are capable of extracting from the collected data hidden knowledge in order to produce models that can be used for prediction and decision making. On the other hand, they also include algorithms and systems that are capable of learning from experience and adapting to their environment or their users. The EnterpriseInformation Systems research group at the Institute for Computer Science at University of Bonn was established in 2013 in is led by Prof. Sören Auer. The group focuses onresearch leading to applications of Linked Data for Enterprise Data integration. Both Prof.Stefan Wrobel and Prof. Sören Auer hold joint leadership positions at Fraunhofer IAIS.
