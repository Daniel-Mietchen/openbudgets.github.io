OK Greece is the official chapter of Open Knowledge in Greece. Led by Dr. Charalampos Bratsas,it is a non government organization that pursues openness and public information freedom in Greece, through participation and transparency activities. It is supported by a national network of volunteers most of which are experienced professionals in the fields of Computer Science, Mathematics, Medicine, Journalism etc. 

Members of the local chapter had previously created the first Greek Linked Open Data Cloud consisting mainly of government data nodes (Clarity programme, criminality data, wildfires data). OKFN Greece members have undertaken the Greek DBpedia realization, creating the Internationalized Extraction Framework, which further led to the establishment of the DBpedia Internationalization Committee. During its one­ year lifetime, OKFN Greece has also led the OpenData activities in Greece. 

OKFN Greece built the Greek Open Data Hub, a central repository of the greek open datasets, getting praise from the European Commission’s Vice President, Neelie Kroes. 

Open Knowledge Foundation Greece recently organized the apps4Greece competition, starting from Thessaloniki, which gave the citizens the opportunity to share over 200 ideas for open dataapplications and resulted to 14 ready to download and use open source applications. 

OKFN Greece participates in the formulations of the Policy of the Greek Open Government for OGP2014. OKFN Greece is also a strong player in transparency matters in Greece, having signedan MoU with the Greek Ministry of Finance, to provide consulting services to the General Secretariat of Public Revenue and also participate in the development of applications on linked government open data.
