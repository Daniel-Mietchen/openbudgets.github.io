The Open Knowledge Deutschland (OK DE) the German Chapter of Open Knowledge International (OK). It is an independent non-for-profit organisation founded in 2011 and dedicated to promoting open data and open content in all their forms – including public information, publicly funded research and public domain cultural content. It is an international leader in its field and has extensive experience in building tools and community around open material. OKF DE is a Think-and-Do Tank that combines legal expertise and technical know-how to advise government authorities and other organisations publish open data and to help potential re-users to engage with open data to create innovative new products and services. OKF DE works on technologies that enable greater transparency in public life and new spaces for citizen engagement. 

OKF DE runs a variety of projects including www.offenerhaushalt.de - a visualisation of the scaped federal budget of Germany, www.offenesparlament.de - legislative activity tracking system for both chambers of the German parliament and www.fragdenstaat.de a platform for freedom of Information requests. OKF DE’s team has significantly contributed to OpenSpending, a platform to publish, visualize and analyse budget and spending data. The database is a resource for the many individuals and groups who wish to discuss and investigate public financial information, including journalists, academics, campaigners, and more. OKF DE is part of an active global network, which includes Working Groups and Local Groups and Partners in dozens of countries – around the world and in 21 of Europe’s 27 Member States. OKF DE runs numerous events – from small, hands-on policy workshops and code sprints, to large-scale conferences, including Open Knowledge Conference.
