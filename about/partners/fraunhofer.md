The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V. is with more than 20,000 employees and 2 Billion Euro annual research budget one of the leading organisations for applied research world-wide. The Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) is the Fraunhofer Society’s “data institute” and one of the most renowned research institutions in the data science area, with an extremely strong track record in data mining, machine learning, semantic technologies, information retrieval and software engineering. 

The research results are documented through a vast number of publications (> 200 publications since 2010) in renowned conferences (e.g. KDD, ICML, ICDM, AAAI, UAI,IJCAI, ECML / PKDD, WWW, CIKM, Coling, IEEE VAST, ACM GIS) and leading journals (Machine Learning JMLR, data mining and knowledge discovery, ACM computing Surveys). IAIS staff is represented in all relevant organizational and editorial boards and program committees of relevant conferences (WWW, ICML, ISWC, ILP, ECML / PKDD). 

In addition to the strong position in research IAIS has an outstanding track record in exploitation and transfer of research results. In addition to application-oriented European research projects, this is demonstrated in particular through contractual research performed for customers in telecommunications (Vodafone, Nokia Siemens), financial services and insurance (Allianz, Commerzbank), publishers (Springer, Zeit), retail (Rewe,Douglas) and logistics (Deutsche Post). Through its business consultants networks and CRM database IAIS has strong ties to all large German companies and a significant share of Germany’s SMEs. 

IAIS employs 260 scientists, developers, project managers and business consultants. IAISis a member of BITKOM, which represents Germany’s IT, telecommunication and digital media sectors, of the Networked European Software and Services Initiative (NESSI), and of the Smart Data Innovation Lab, an initiative of IT industry and academia in Germany. IAIS coordinates 24 institutes from various engineering sectors in Fraunhofer’s Big Data Alliance and its vocational training for data scientists. 

**Organized Knowledge (OK)**, one of five Fraunhofer IAIS departments, engages in research and development of technology for information, data and knowledge integration using Linked Data. An outstanding example of OK’s seasoned engineering capabilities is the German Digital Library (Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek, http://ddb.de), which aggregates and integrates data from more than 2,000 archives, museums and libraries.
