OpenBudgets consortium member [Open Knowledge Greece](http://okfn.gr/) has developed Indigo as part of the prototype launch of the platform this month. The public is invited to test the tool and its first set of functions, that are to be extended later in the duration of the project. 

Indigo is an application that will let you apply data analysis algorithms on fiscal datasets, structured with the OpenBudgets datamodel. Users of the tool can gain new and exciting insights into budget and spending data by applying a provided set of data processing tools.

Currently, the prototype showcases a first of those tools: the time series algorithm lets you preview the development of the budget. Choose a dataset and define the criteria relevant to answer your question. Indigo will then show you a variety of visualisations. Have a look at the **screencast below** to see how it works, or [go straight to the tool](http://eis-openbudgets.iais.fraunhofer.de/indigo/) to try it out for yourself!

During the next months, more algorithms will be developed and included into Indigo.
