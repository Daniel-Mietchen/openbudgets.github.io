  For the beta version, we have developed tools around the three pillars of the project: <b>data analytics</b>, <b>citizen engagement</b>, and <b>journalism</b>. In the realm of data analytics, we present a  time series forecasting algorithm that integrates with OpenSpending and predicts and visualizes the development of budgets into the future. As for citizen engagement, the participatory budgeting interface lets users preview the interaction with the budget allocation process. Finally, the highly praised ‘budget cooking recipes’ website highlights the journalistic value of budget data by listing cases in which it has been used to investigate corruption.

# Data Analytics

[Open Knowledge Greece](http://okfn.gr/), a chapter of the Open Knowledge Network based in Thessaloniki and partner in OpenBudets.eu has now developed **Indigo**. Using the tool, you can perform time series analysis of budget data, and create your own fiscal indicators. In the future, you will be able to apply many more algorithms.

# Civic Engagement

Our partner [ Civio](http://www.civio.es/) has developed an interface that combines the different user needs for voting, monitoring and announcing budget processes. As the front-runner in the field of visualisation public procurement, budgets and expenditure, governmental pardons, public-private power networks and conflicts of interests in Spain, it is part of their advocacy agenda to close the feedback loop in the decision-making cycle.

# Journalism

[J++](http://www.jplusplus.org/en/) showcases the power of incorporating budget and spending data into journalism with their 'Budget Cooking Recipes'. The website satirically demonstrates the variety of possibilities through which corruption can occur in relation to budget data

# The Future 

Tools, data and stories will be continuously added and improved over the next months as three large-scale pilot scenarios in the domains of participatory budgeting, data journalism and corruption prevention will be launched to gain further insights. These insights will feed  into the overall platform for fiscal data.
