On the **30th of November** and the **1st of December**, Open Knowledge International and Open Knowledge Germany are organizing a workshop to address the question: "**How might Open Data Contribute to of Fiscal Policy?**" in Berlin. The workshop is part of the ongoing work for the OpenBudgets.eu project.

Journalists, Civil Society Organizations, and Public Officials all work on creating a better understanding of Public Budgets and Expenditures. Often, internal processes on liberating those fiscal data could seem black boxes from the outside. We'd like to unpack these work processes to foster better cooperation and understand what role open data can play. 

Together with key-figures from the field of journalism, civil society and governments, we will build scenarios how different actors impact the democratisation of fiscal policy. We will be working with a small group of 20 participants. The results of the workshop will be published on openbudgets.eu.
