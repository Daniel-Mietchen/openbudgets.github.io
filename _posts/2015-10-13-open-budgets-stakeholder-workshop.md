The first Open Budgets Stakeholder Workshop invites a variety of different stakeholders working with budget data (journalists, civil society organisations, activists, parlamentarians) in order to explore the chances of OpenBudgets.eu as a tool for their their work in fiscal transparency. 

How is budget data used to generate impact, and which factors are detrimental in this respect? What is the role of technical solutions, tools and platforms like open budgets in campaigns and stories around public budgets (incl. allocation, anti-corruption etc)? How might open data contribute to the democratisation of fiscal policy?
