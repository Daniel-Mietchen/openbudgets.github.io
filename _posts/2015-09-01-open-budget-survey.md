“*To meet the world’s most pressing challenges – including ending poverty and addressing climate change – will require the wise investment of public resources. National budgets that are accountable, efficient, and effective are crucial.*”

Findings from the Open Budget Survey 2015, published by the <a href="http://internationalbudget.org/">International Budget Partnership</a>, reveal that the vast majority of people live in countries that have inadequate systems for ensuring accountable budgets. Most countries surveyed provide insufficient information for civil society and the public to understand or monitor budgets, and only a small fraction of countries have appropriate mechanisms for the public to participation in budget processes. Formal oversight institutions also frequently face limitations in performing their function of holding governments to account.

The key findings of the Open Budget Survey 2015 can be found <a href="http://internationalbudget.org/opening-budgets/open-budget-initiative/open-budget-survey/publications-2/rankings-key-findings/key-findings/">here</a>.
