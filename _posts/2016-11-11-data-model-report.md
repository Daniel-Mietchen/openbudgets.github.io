This report is to be used as a self-contained guide to modelling datasets according to the OpenBudgets.eu data model. It contains the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary guide showing how the vocabulary is used throughout the data model. There are also IRI patterns that should be followed when creating datasets and code lists in OpenBudgets.eu. 

The process of modelling a dataset is described through all necessary steps and is illustrated using examples. Also included are modelling patterns that are to be considered during dataset transformation as well as the recommended metadata and validation techniques. The data model is illustrated on two use cases. The last part of this deliverable is a data model reference which includes descriptions and usage examples of individual classes and properties in the core OpenBudgets.eu data model.
