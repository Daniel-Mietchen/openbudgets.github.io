Deliverable 1.2 with the title 'Design of data structure definition for public budget data' has been published and is available [here (910KB)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Deliverables/D1.2.pdf). 

In this demonstrator deliverable, we describe the data structure definition for public budget data using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary to be used in OpenBudgets.eu. The definition contains core properties and code lists to be reused across multiple budget datasets and a way to include new properties and datasets as needed. We demonstrate the usage of the definition on a sample of the budget of the European Union. 


**Executive Summary:**
In this demonstrator deliverable, a set of OpenBudgets.eu core RDF component properties for description of budget data is presented. The deliverable is based on results achieved in a survey and knowledge elicitation performed with domain experts and reported in Deliverable D1.1 (Klímek, Kučera, Mynarz, Sedmihradská, & Zbranek, 2015). In addition to the component properties definitions, a method of creation of additional component properties and the data structure definitions themselves is presented and illustrated by an example of the budget of the European Union.
