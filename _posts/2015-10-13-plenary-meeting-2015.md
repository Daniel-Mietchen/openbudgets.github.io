During the Open Budgets Plenary Meeting on the 30th of November and 1st of December, the consortium partners will meet in Berlin to review the progress made since the start of the project. The strategy for the coming months will be discussed in a series of group sessions and workshops aimed at finding solutions for the challenges encountered. 

The meeting will happen simultaneously with the stakeholder workshop to ensure the participation and exchange of both the consortium partners of Open Budgets and the stakeholders working with budget data. The results of the events will be published soon after the event.
