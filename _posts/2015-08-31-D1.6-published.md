Deliverable 1.6, a 'Survey of code lists for the data modelâ€™s coded dimensions' has been published and is available to download [here (2,1MB)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/deliverables/D1.6.pdf). 

In this deliverable, fiscal code classifications that were found after a thorough research among released datasets are listed. The code lists are analyzed and classified according to their purpose and properties. This deliverable is essential for the construction of the OpenBudgets platform, as it is one of the central objectives to create the possibility to include as many different data sources as possible, with respect to the varying fiscal code classifications. 

**Executive Summary:**

This document presents the research undertaken in order to discover, collect and categorize code lists that have direct or indirect relationship with fiscal datasets. Section 1 introduces the purpose and the scope of the research.

In Section 2 we describe the methodology behind the process of finding and categorizing the code lists. Section 3 provides a summary of the discovered results together with depictions of various categorization variables. After Section 4 and the conclusion, Section 5 follows with an exhaustive listing of the code lists that have been found for each category.

This deliverable is part of WP1, Data Structure Definition for Budgets and Public Spending.
